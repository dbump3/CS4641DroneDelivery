## Introduction & Background
This problem is a current [Kaggle competition]https://www.kaggle.com/c/hashcode-drone-delivery/overview at time of attempting this project. 


## Methods

### Q-Learning
We expect to first use Q-Learning to solve the problem through reinforcement learning. 

### Graphical Neural Network (GNN)
Our stretch goal is to use a Graphical Neural Network (GNN), an uncommon approach. This implementation will be very difficult, which is why we left it as a stretch goal, however, we believe it is an extremely interesting and novel approach to the problem that may produce better results than typical approaches.
