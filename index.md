## Introduction & Background



## Methods

We expect to first use Q-Learning to solve the problem through reinforcement learning.

Our stretch goal is to use a Graphical Neural Network, an uncommon approach. This implementation will be very difficult, which is why we left it as a stretch goal, however, we believe it is an extremely interesting and novel approach to the problem that may produce better results than typical approaches.
